robots have modules and memory
memory stores your infinitely-reproducable inventory
modules are hardware slots and can carry GUNZ or extra memory or other things that would require hardware
LAZERZ do not require modules

ENERGY is what determines robots' movement and battle continuation ability
one energy is spent per tile moved and attack performed. half of energy is restored upon turn start. the average energy cap is much higher than the average stamina cap. it starts at half

MODULES ARE CLASS-BASED
PROGRAMZ CAN PROVIDE BUFFS
YOU CAN COPY OR DELETE ONE THING PER TURN

gun modules can carry one gun of any type that you have the dependencies for
select modules when attacking

inventory is only limited by the amount of memory you have
duplicate PROGRAMZ stack

WAVES are capable of BUFFING and other noncombat effects
